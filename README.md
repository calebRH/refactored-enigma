This will be my super cool repository where I keep all the little projects for ATMOne before they're big enough to justify putting in their own repositories.

* Working primarily on an inventory tracking system that allows us to more easily track supplies
* Also looking at making a wiki-like website that allows us to have a better system of documentation. I'd even like to extend this to making our system of file sharing more user-friendly overall
